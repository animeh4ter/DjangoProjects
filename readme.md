# That`s a repository for all my Django projects
## Databases/sql files/other are specially in the repository so that you can view the work with them, I know that in fact they need to be ignored
### PS: Please notice that I am not a WEB designer/Frontend developer, I know the sites looks bad, that's not my fault, I tried to make them as beautiful as possible
